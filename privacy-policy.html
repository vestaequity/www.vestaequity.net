</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclosure and Sale of Personal Information for Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>As defined in the CCPA, "sell" and “sale” mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for valuable consideration. This means we may have received some kind of benefit for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.</p>
<p>We may use, disclose, or sell and may have used, disclosed, or sold in the last twelve (12) months the following categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes:</p>

<li>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal information were disclosed.</p>
<p>When we disclose personal information for a business or a commercial purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing Personal Information</strong>

<p>
We may share your personal information identified in the above categories with the following categories of third parties:</p>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>Your Rights under the CCPA</strong>

<li><strong>The right not to be discriminated against.</strong> You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your consumer rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Exercising Your CCPA Data Protection Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>To exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, and if you are a California resident, you can contact us by email.</p>
<p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information.
Your request must:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Please describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with the required information if we cannot:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Verify your identity or authority to make the request</li>
<li>And confirm that the personal information relates to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will disclose and deliver the required information within 45 days of receiving your verifiable request. The period to provide the required information may be extended by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary and with prior notice. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12 months preceding the verifiable request’s receipt.</p>
<p>For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>
<strong>“Do Not Track” Requests</strong>
</p>
<p>As California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) requires, we disclose that our Service does not respond to Do Not Track signals. Some third-party websites do keep track of your browsing activities. If you are visiting such websites, you can set your preferences in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable DNT by visiting your web browser's preferences or settings page.</p>
