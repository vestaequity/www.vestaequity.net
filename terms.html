</p>
<p>
For property owners, your Property will be professionally appraised and

listed on the Marketplace. You will then be provided with a blockchain
wallet and your property will be tokenized as an NFT. It is at your
discretion to decide what percentage of the property you wish to sell and
then list it on our Marketplace.
</p>
<p>
For investors, once your Account is approved, you can view all investment
listings on the Marketplace. A blockchain digital wallet is required to be
established or imported first before you can purchase tokenized property
equity on the Marketplace.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>FEES &amp; TRANSACTIONS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
All Marketplace transactions will be conducted in USDC stablecoins solely
through the blockchain-backed network. We will have no insight into or
control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to
reverse any transactions.

<p>
We may charge fees for the use of the Service of certain features, now or

<p>
<strong><u>EXCLUSIVE REMEDY</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Without limiting the limitation of liability above, in the event of any
problem with the Services, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is
to cease using the Service. Under no circumstances shall Vesta Equity, its
parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents or employees
be liable in any way for your use of Services, including, but not limited
to, any errors or omissions in the Service, any infringement by the Service
of the intellectual property rights or other rights of third parties, or
for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the
Service. Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
consequential damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to
you.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>INDEMNIFICATION</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, you will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Vesta Equity and its past, present and future
employees, partners, contractors, consultants, suppliers, vendors, service
providers, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns
(the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against all claims, demands, actions,
damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise
from or relate to: (i) your use of the platform or any services, (ii) your
responsibilities or obligations under these Terms, (iii) your violation of
these Terms, or (iv) your violation of any rights of any other person or
entity.
</p>
<p>
The Company reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense,
at your expense, of any claim subject to indemnification. This indemnity is
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a
written agreement between you and us.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>DISCLAIMER</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
The Service is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all
faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing,
course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
representation of any kind that the Service will meet your requirements,
achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other
software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any
errors or defects can or will be corrected.
</p>
<p>
Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service,
or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon;
(ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the
accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or
e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts,
trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
</p>
<p>
You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing
online over the internet, and agree that we have no liability or
responsibility for any breach of security unless it is due to our gross
negligence.
</p>
<p>
We will not be responsible or liable to you for any losses you incur as the
result of your use of the blockchain network or an electronic wallet,
including but not limited to any losses, damages or claims arising from:
(a) user error, such as forgotten passwords or incorrectly construed smart
contracts or other transactions; (b) server failure or data loss; (c)
corrupted wallet files; (d) unauthorized access or activities by third
parties, including but not limited to the use of viruses, phishing,
bruteforcing or other means of attack against the Website, blockchain
network, or an electronic wallet.
</p>
<p>
All smart contracts are conducted and occur through our code, and all
transactions are recorded on the decentralized ledger within the blockchain
network. For clarity, we have no control over and make no guarantees or
promises with respect to the functionality of the blockchain and/or the
execution of smart contracts and/or transactions.
</p>
<p>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so
some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.
But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section
shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
</p>
<p>
The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the
price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the
value of your tokenized property or other items, which may also be subject
to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchases of
tokenized properties or other items will not lose money.
</p>
<p>
You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to
your transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that
apply to your transactions on the Website or any blockchain.
</p>
<p>
We do not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by
virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Website’s supporting
blockchain network. Any transfer of NFTs or cryptocurrencies occur within
the supporting blockchain network, and not on the Website.
</p>
<p>
There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency,
including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet
connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within
your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for
any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you
may experience when using the blockchain network, however caused.
</p>
<p>
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies,
and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially
adversely affect the development of the our ecosystem, and therefore the
potential utility or value of your NFTs.
</p>
<p>
