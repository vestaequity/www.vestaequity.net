<strong><u>ACCOUNT AND REGISTRATION</u></strong>
</p>

Anyone can browse our Website without registering for an account, but you

your property, uploading photos and making a transaction on the
marketplace. By creating an Account with us, you represent and warrant that
you have provided accurate and updated information and you will keep your
Account password confidential.
</p>
<p>
An Account is approved through a thorough process of collecting and
verifying information for digital identification (ID), Know Your Customer
(KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance purposes. During the
process, we may ask for your name, address, date of birth and other

license, passport, or other government ID documents and we may take steps
to verify the accuracy of the information you provide in your account
application.

<strong><u>VESTA PROPERTY MARKETPLACE</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Vesta Property Marketplace is an open market of tokenized property equity,
or Non-Fungible Token (NFT), where property owners and investors deal
directly with one another to buy and sell.<strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
For property owners, your Property will be professionally appraised and
your ownership will be verified before your property is approved to be
listed on the Marketplace. You will then be provided with a blockchain
wallet and your property will be tokenized as an NFT. It is at your
discretion to decide what percentage of the property you wish to sell and
then list it on our Marketplace.
</p>
<p>
For investors, once your Account is approved, you can view all investment
listings on the Marketplace. A blockchain digital wallet is required to be
established or imported first before you can purchase tokenized property
equity on the Marketplace.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>FEES &amp; TRANSACTIONS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
All Marketplace transactions will be conducted in USDC stablecoins solely
through the blockchain-backed network. We will have no insight into or
control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to
reverse any transactions.
</p>
<p>
We may charge fees for the use of the Service of certain features, now or
in the future. You acknowledge that the prevailing rate of commissions and
fees may change and that change may occur without notice. You agree to pay
to us all applicable fees for the Service under your account at the

<strong><u>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Vesta Equity and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers,

for any punitive, exemplary, consequential, incidental, indirect or special
damages (including, without limitation, any personal injury, lost profits,
business interruption, loss of programs or other data on your computer or
otherwise) arising from or in connection with your use of the Services,
whether under a theory of breach of contract, tort, negligence, strict
liability, malpractice, any other legal or equitable theory or otherwise,
even if Vesta Equity has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
You hereby release Vesta Equity and hold it and its parents, subsidiaries,
affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees harmless from any and
all claims, demands, and damages of every kind and nature (including,
without limitation, actual, special, incidental and consequential), known
and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising
out of or in any way connected with your use of the Services. You waive the
provisions of any state or local law limiting or prohibiting a general
release.
</p>
<p>
The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent
permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. This limitation of
liability also applies with respect to damages incurred by you by reason of
any products or services sold or provided on any linked sites or otherwise
by third parties other than Vesta Equity and received through the Services

</p>
<p>
<strong><u>EXCLUSIVE REMEDY</u></strong>

for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the

implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
consequential damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to
you.

<p>
<strong><u>INDEMNIFICATION</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, you will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Vesta Equity and its past, present and future

</p>
<p>
<strong><u>DISCLAIMER</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
The Service is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all
faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service

statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing,
course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
representation of any kind that the Service will meet your requirements,
achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other
software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any
errors or defects can or will be corrected.
</p>
<p>
Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service,
or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon;
(ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the
accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or
e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts,
trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
</p>
<p>
You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing
online over the internet, and agree that we have no liability or
responsibility for any breach of security unless it is due to our gross
negligence.
</p>
<p>
We will not be responsible or liable to you for any losses you incur as the
result of your use of the blockchain network or an electronic wallet,
including but not limited to any losses, damages or claims arising from:
(a) user error, such as forgotten passwords or incorrectly construed smart
contracts or other transactions; (b) server failure or data loss; (c)
corrupted wallet files; (d) unauthorized access or activities by third
parties, including but not limited to the use of viruses, phishing,
bruteforcing or other means of attack against the Website, blockchain
network, or an electronic wallet.
</p>
<p>
All smart contracts are conducted and occur through our code, and all
transactions are recorded on the decentralized ledger within the blockchain
network. For clarity, we have no control over and make no guarantees or
promises with respect to the functionality of the blockchain and/or the
execution of smart contracts and/or transactions.
</p>
<p>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so
some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.
But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section
shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
</p>
<p>
The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the
price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the
value of your tokenized property or other items, which may also be subject
to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchases of
tokenized properties or other items will not lose money.
</p>
<p>
You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to
your transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that
apply to your transactions on the Website or any blockchain.
</p>
<p>
We do not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by
virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Website’s supporting
blockchain network. Any transfer of NFTs or cryptocurrencies occur within
the supporting blockchain network, and not on the Website.
</p>
<p>
There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency,
including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet
connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within
your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for
any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you
may experience when using the blockchain network, however caused.
</p>
<p>
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies,
and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially
adversely affect the development of the our ecosystem, and therefore the
potential utility or value of your NFTs.
</p>
<p>
